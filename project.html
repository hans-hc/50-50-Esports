            <p>
                We have chosen Mekaeel as our client to work with. He is a #1 ranked League of Legends esports
                tournament player and has expressed his desire for a website that details all the different esports
                organizations and related games from around the world. He isn’t currently playing for a team, but is
                hoping our website would give him some ideas in addition to eventually helping others find what they
                need.
            <h2 id="Project Overview">Project Overview:</h2>
            <p>
                Our goal is to develop a website that displays the various esports teams from around the world and the
                respective games in which these teams compete, as well as showing off various sponsors and affiliations
                related to in-game events, tournaments, and information on finding teams. Although our website is
                accessible and functional for all users, our design is geared towards the younger demographic,
                specifically those involved in the world of esports. In general the website is fully inclusive, though
                registered players must take note of the specific age eligibility of their desired event(s). This should
                be device friendly; although more desktop users are likely to visit, we plan to design it with all
                device formats in mind. The basic information that will be on the site will consist of our goal for the
                site, developers’ info, contact information, affiliations and certainly more as we learn more about how
                we will further design the overall website. Our design will consist of a modern and slick page
                configuration, composed of a black background and exhibiting red and white font-styles with a robotic
                yet artsy font quality. The client has expressed his desire for the site not to be dull wishing to avoid
                a lacklustre color palette. He also expressed his wishes for some flow between the pages, which we will
                achieve through simple, yet effective animations and satisfying navigation. The content portion of the
                website is an important factor which will consist predominantly of browsing sections for viewing esports
                teams’ scheduled games, rosters, upcoming tournaments and more. The site will also contain personal info
                about the esports teams, including past tournament results, biographical information, and historical
                team trade catalogues. The site will contain affiliations and sponsors throughout the pages and
                testimonies/reviews which can be found in the home page. Search bars and navigation buttons will be
                readily accessible located at the top of the page to be used for finding a specific team or game. More
                content ideas will be brought up as we work further with our client. There are currently no specific
                plans for any interactive elements like games or pop-ups, however as stated earlier animations and
                accessibility features will be implemented and information for specific content can be viewed by
                clicking on that particular item. Further interactivity will be discussed with our client. This is our
                current vision for WorldWide Esports, which of course will take many shapes as time goes on, though it
                will follow these general principles.
