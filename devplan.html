            <h2 id="subtitle">1: Our team, the client, and the app</h2>
            <p>
                Team members are Mike, Evan, Hansen and Andrew. Our client is Mekaeel, a professional esports player
                looking to offer coaching services and advice in a selection of competitive esports games. We are 50/50,
                and we plan to build one collective web app/website, accessible through the internet.
            </p>
            <h2 id="subtitle">2: Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                Our app is designed to allow players to connect with coaches and professional players in regards to
                coaching, advice and strategy for different games. Users will be able to post questions and inquire
                about their gameplay within discussion pages (similar to reddit “threads”) for each game, where other
                users and coaches will be able to answer and interact with them. Furthermore, users will be able to view
                the profiles of different coaches to connect and arrange private coaching sessions at the coach’s
                selected rate. We also have plans to work with pro esports teams, where users will be able to submit
                gameplay or compete in tryouts if a team is looking for new players. Players and coaches will each have
                to create an account/profile, where various info and data will be displayed.
                To summarize, under each game title, users will be able to:
                Post gameplay footage, questions, and ask for advice,
                view upcoming esports events for the related game title, and
                view a list of pro players and expand into their profiles.

                Under each profile, the following data/information will be available to the public:
                Verified badge, played games,
                coaching availability *optional, coaching rates*, coach rating (out of 5 stars)*, and related game
                titles.

            </p>
            <h2 id="subtitle">3: Data Description</h2>
            <p>
                Table 1: Coaches information
                We will need a table to store the information detailing all the accounts registered as coaches on the
                website.
                Each coach profile will store information detailing the coach’s name, age, games of expertise, coaching
                rate(optional), coaching rating, and presence of a verification badge.
                Field names and associated data types: coachID(int, primary key), name(string), age(int), games(array of
                strings), rate(float), rating(float (0.0 to 5.0)), verified(boolean).
            </p>
            <p>
                Table 2: Standard User Information
                We will need a table to store the information detailing all the accounts registered as players on the
                website.
                Each player profile will store information detailing the player’s name and games of interest.
                Field names and associated data types: playerID(int, primary key), name(string), games(array of
                strings).
            </p>
            <p>
                Table 3: Games
                We will need a table to store the information outlining all the biggest games in the esports industry
                and their descriptions
                Each game will store information detailing the game name and description.
                Field names and associated data types: gameID(int, primary key), name(string), description(string).
            </p>
            <p>
                Table 4: Discussion Boards
                We will need a table to store the discussions held under the discussion boards of the website.
                Each discussion board will store information detailing the discussion post author, discussion post
                heading, discussion post responses/comments and their respective authors.
                Field names and associated data types: boardID(int, primary key), author(int (this will be the author’s
                playerID/coachID)), type(boolean (this will identify whether the author is a player or a coach)),
                post(string), discussions(2D Array - Each inner array will represent a discussion post based on the
                following format [writer(int), type(boolean), post(string)])
            </p>
            <h2 id="subtitle">4: Functions performed by the app</h2>
            <p>
                Users can post questions starting thread-like conversations for coaches to respond to. Some sort of
                ‘post’ function will add the user’s message to a database and display it when that thread is opened on
                the app. Users will also be able to rate verified coaches based on their experience in real life with
                them as an esports player and thus a rating function should allow a user’s input rating to be saved to a
                database of the coaches information. Users should be able to create an account with information like
                whether they are a player or a coach and can be verified, so a create account function should be added
                and will add this information to a user database.
            </p>
            <h2 id="subtitle">5: Role of PHP and JavaScript</h2>
            <p>
                PHP will be used to store the data required to be displayed by the web app. This includes the users’
                (coaches and players) contact information/profiles saved by the web app. A list of games within the
                esports industry. A list of coaches registered on the website along with their associated ratings and
                games. A “thread-style” question and response data section which will save question-response
                conversations between players and coaches.


                The bulk of the code will be written in PHP rather than javascript, due to the vast amount of data
                required to be saved through server-side programming.


                PHP will work with Javascript through…
                1. Event listeners to track when users create or sign into an account, post or respond to a question on
                a
                “thread”, or give ratings to a certain coach. When these event listeners are activated, PHP will be used
                to collect and save the data on the website.
                2. Calculating coaches’ ratings. PHP will be used to store all the ratings a certain coach has been
                given.
                Javascript will be used to calculate the overall rating a coach has amassed given the list of user
                ratings.
            </p>
            <h2 id="subtitle">6: Roles of Team Members</h2>
            <p>
                We will spread the responsibility across a few important web pages that are part of the same app,
                including the home/about page, games browsing page, players and coaches leaderboard and account creation
                page. This may change in the future but those are the core aspects of our app. Everyone should be
                responsible for maintaining consistency and should all be using javascript, html and php since all our
                web pages require structure, design and database interaction. More specifically, Hansen will be frontend, working on design and css styling, while also connecting the backend to frontend elements. Mikey will also be frontend, working on site animations and javascript.
                Andrew and Evan will work on the backened together, working on PHP and ensuring the databases are correctly implemented.
            </p>
            <h2 id="subtitle">7: The Increments</h2>
            <p>
                By the date of the first increment, our web app will contain a basic layout without functionality for
                the following:
                A profile creation page in which players and coaches will be able to create profiles that will contain
                their personal data and contact information.
                A page containing a detailed, tile-structured list of games within the esports industry.
                A page containing a structured list of coaches(along with their associated ratings and personal details)
                harbouring accounts on the 50/50 website.
                A sign-in page where users can sign into their created account(s).

            </p>
            <h2 id="subtitle">8: Client Feedback</h2>
            <p>
                Our client's main concern was the time constraint. The features we plan to implement are ambitious, and
                our client Mekaeel had the following say:
            </p>
            <p>
                “Will you ensure all these functions are completed before the project deadline? What would be cut if the
                timing doesn’t work out?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Our response? To stay on track with the deadline, our priority is to develop a high-quality esports
                information hub and coach directory rather than an open forum. This means we will focus on key features
                like detailed coach profiles, verified coach contact options, and an esports event database. If time
                becomes a constraint, we would scale back or delay features like gameplay submissions for tryouts or
                interactive discussion boards, ensuring the core functionalities—informing users about esports and
                connecting them with professional coaches—are fully polished and operational first.
