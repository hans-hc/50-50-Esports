            <p><b>Consistency:</b></p>
            <p>
                While the website is generally consistent in its overall layout, it is unclear on first look as a new
                visitor what each block of text is used for. The color scheme is incredibly inconsistent as different
                blocks of media and text are various different colors, most of which are unnecessarily flashy and make
                the user experience overwhelming. There is no specific scheme for how the colors are distributed in the
                website which makes similar text blocks unreliable and hard to identify.
            </p>
            <p><b>Ease Of Navigation:</b></p>
            <p>
                The website is difficult to navigate as well, due to the overwhelming choice of colors and lack of a
                concrete layout. The general white navigation box on the top left includes the major webpages, however
                it took a while to realize it was even there. These major links should be front and center for visitors
                to see and easily be redirected to their desired page. There is no clear use of a header or footer, just
                some contact and organization information, and the content section is mediocre at best. The quick links
                menu on the Home page should have been implemented into the header as opposed to a drop down lower on
                the page, as its current form feels out-of-place and takes a lot of space to display all the links,
                which isn’t mobile friendly.
            </p>
            <p><b>Universal Usability</b></p>
            <p>
                This surprisingly isn’t a large problem, as text and general layout items flatten to accommodate for
                smaller screens, although it is questionable why on a desktop screen the layout only takes up the left
                third of the screen and is not all centered to more effectively use the whole space to display the
                items. Additionally, the previously noted white navigation box on the top-left becomes a hamburger icon
                on the top right on a smaller screen which drops the menu down from the top resembling a header. This
                should have just been a header from the beginning.
            </p>
            <p><b>Error Prevention</b></p>
            <p>
                One thing of note is that all blocks of text and media include a white tab on the bottom right which
                provides details on the editor and last edit date, which is completely unnecessary for the visitor’s
                experience. Outside of that, error prevention doesn’t seem to be a huge concern for this website, but
                the previous 3 principles could certainly use some work.

            <p>
                Even when clicking into a listing, the header remains the same, with the clickable icon to return to
                home page, search bar, and user account information. The footer also remains the same from the home
                page. The same color scheme is used throughout the website, with red-pink color accents, a light user
                interface, and black text for simplicity. Minimal and simple icons are utilized to present an overall
                modern look, which is also complemented by AirBnB’s own typeface font “Cereal”.

            <p>
                Upon entering the site, users are immediately presented with different housing listings. The search bar
                at the top of the page has different user specifications, which is collapsed as you scroll down. As
                mentioned previously, even when clicking into a listing, the header remains the same, with the clickable
                icon to return to home page, search bar, and user account information. This ensures a user is able to
                access core functions even when clicked into a listing. In the home page under the header, there are
                different housing options to select.
            </p>
            <p><b>Universal Usability:</b></p>
            <p>
                The usability for this website is fantastic, as it implements responsive design aspects that we learned
                in lecture. The website viewed on a larger desktop screen layout efficiently uses space to its advantage
                and frankly, the user’s advantage. When the screen size is reduced, text is compressed and images are
                reduced in size and are set in an easy, vertical layout so mobile users can quickly scroll down to view
                listings.
            </p>
            <p><b>Error Prevention:</b></p>
            <p>
                The website effectively prevents errors by providing clear feedback and simple navigation. Users are
                less likely to encounter broken links or confusing layouts, ensuring a smooth experience.
